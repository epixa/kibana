# Alerts POC

## To Do's

- Example of throttling
- ~~Default set of values per alert (subject, body, message, etc)~~
- Figure out the "Send Message" terminology
- ~~Muting functionality per scheduled alert~~
	- ~~Time based?~~

## Nice to haves

- Scenario of 100,000 different hostnames
	- Bulk get data, check function runs per host
- Add kibana task manager to POC
- Resiliency
- Audit log
- Queues?
	- Sending emails goes into a queue
	- Leverage task manager?
